            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

            <p>This is the post explaining my third work term at <a href="https://arcticwolf.com/">Arctic Wolf Networks</a> in Waterloo. This was my third co-op and my first real introduction to being a developer in a professional environment. This post should help you see what I learned and how I grew as a developer over the 4 months I was there.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Employer Info</h2>

            <p><a href="https://arcticwolf.com/">Arctic Wolf Networks</a> is Cyber Security company that offers SOC (Security Operations Center) as a Service. They collect logs, packets, and other data, analyze this data and then provide it to a Security Engineer to take a look at. They are currently a company of ~250 people but are quickly growing. All of R&D is based out of Waterloo, but they also have employees in California, Utah, and in Minnesota.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
            <p>I was hired as a software developer and was placed on two different teams, LÃ¼mberjacks and The Precogs. My duties on both teams were pretty similar, I wrote and updated parsers for different log lines we recieved from customers. Some of my other duties involved creating summary reports of important events that were given to customers weekly.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the work term went smoothly, as onboarding took less than a week. I was actively contributing within a week of starting work. The first few weeks were all about coming up to speed with parsing using Python at Arctic Wolf. I learned about Grok patterns and learned a lot more Regex. For the first sprint I was just fixing simple parser errors but after that I got to do some more interesting things.</p>
            <p>After the first sprint, the two teams felt like I was ready to start taking on harder problems such as writing new parsers from scratch. This was much more interesting, as I got to look into log lines, find the valuable security information within them and parse it into a JSON object to be later put into Elastic Search for the Security Engineers to look at. I learned a lot about both techniques for parsing and about security from doing this.</p>
            <p>My final big project was to write a parser for a log source which was a log collection agent. The log source sent us lots of different kinds of log lines and the parser needed to find out which log line was which and successfully parse each line. This originally was expected to take 2 sprints (~6 weeks) due to the ocmplexity of the task. I felt as if this should not take this long and ended up solving this problem in only one week, impressing everyone at the company which made me feel amazing.</p>
            <p>Overall, I enjoyed the work term and found parsing to be an interesting challenge to take on, although I would not like to do another work term of parsing.</p>
