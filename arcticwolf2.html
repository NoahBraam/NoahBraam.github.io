            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

            <p>This is the post explaining my fourth/fifth work terms at <a href="https://arcticwolf.com/">Arctic Wolf Networks</a> in Waterloo. This was my second time working at Arctic Wolf, and my second time working as a developer. I grew lots as a developer throughout this work term.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Employer Info</h2>

            <p><a href="https://arcticwolf.com/">Arctic Wolf Networks</a> is Cyber Security company that offers SOC (Security Operations Center) as a Service. They collect logs, packets, and other data, analyze this data and then provide it to a Security Engineer to take a look at. They are currently a company of ~500 people but are quickly growing. All of R&D is based out of Waterloo, but they also have employees in California, Utah, and in Minnesota.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
            <p>I was hired as a software developer and was placed on the 'Detection Infrastructure' team called 'The Watchers on the Wall'. My duties involved maintaining our parsers, improving our data enrichment, and creating infrastructure for other teams.</p>
            <p>The start of the term went smoothly, and onboarding took only a few days as I had done the onboarding before. I got to start with a Golang project which was really enjoyable. Golang is a language I was very interested in learning and becoming comfortable with, and I was super thankful for the opportunity to use it in a professional environment. I sped up our Golang microservice by adding a cache on top of the database that backed the service. Efficiency of the service improved by 100% after adding the cache. It felt great to get that project done and seeing the amazing improvements.</p>
            <p>The second part of my work term was working on improving the infrastructure that my team maintains for other teams. This involved talking to other teams, deciding what was important and what wasn't, creating a plan and a timeline for the plan. This was the first project I was in charge of as a co-op and it was really fulfilling to see a project through from start to finish. The feedback was also awesome as the teams who used the service were all super happy about the improvements I made. It felt like I was actually making an impact and what I was doing was important which is a great feeling as a co-op.</p>
            <p>The final big project I worked on was removing an obsolete part of the code base and removing a big pain point for developers throughout the company. We worked as a team to remove a slow area of our testing code by removing a VM that wasn't required anymore. There was joy throughout the company when we finally got it removed as it was a huge pain point with developers everywhere.</p>
            <p>Overall, I enjoyed the work term and learned a lot. I loved learning Go and having real projects that took a few weeks to finish. I would love to come back to Arctic Wolf in the future and continue to learn.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
            <p>For this work term, I had 3 main goals I wished to accomplish. My first goal was to become more comfortable and proficient in Golang. My second goal was to more thoughroughly understand and become confident with AWS. My final goal was to learn to when to ask questions when I am stuck versus working through it myself.</p>
            <p>My first goal for the term was to become more comfortable and proficient in Golang. To accomplish this goal, I made sure to ask my team lead for the opportunity to use Golang at some point in the term. I was given the opportunity to use Golang for a microservice my team was creating. I got the opportunity to add a cache to the database backing the microservice, greatly improving efficiency of the service. This was my first real experience with Golang and it was a great learning experience. I feel much more comfortable with Golang after this experience and have begun using it for my own personal projects. Overall, I feel like I achieved this goal.</p>
            <p>My second goal for the work term was to more thoughroughly understand and become confident with AWS. Arctic Wolf relies heavily on AWS to deliver its service. In my first work term at Arctic Wolf, I didn't really get to use AWS, though it seemed really interesting. This term, I got to use AWS as I helped create a canary service for some of our services. I also helped with our scaling of some services. I felt much more comfortable navigating and using AWS through the term as I continued to learn and use different AWS services. Overall I feel like I achieved this goal and much more comfortable using AWS.</p>
            <p>My final goal for the term was to learn when to ask questions versus solving the problem myself. This has been an issue for me in the past, as I would often sit at my desk stuck on a problem for days because I felt like I should be able to solve it, when it could have only taken 5 minutes if I had asked a question sooner. This term I went out of my way to really think about when to ask for assistance versus when to solve the problem myself, and I feel like I did this effectively. Everyone on my team was impressed by how quickly I was getting things done due to me figuring out when to ask questions. I am happy to say that I accomplished this goal, and it greatly helped me throughout the term.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Arctic Wolf Networks was my second development based co-op and I learned so much from it. Everyone on the team was nice and super supportive and really helped me along my way. Arctic Wolf as a company is amazing, full of really smart, nice people. The culture is incredible, the managers are amazing and the office space is really nice. I am hoping to cross paths with Arctic Wolf again, and continuing to learn all about new technologies.</p>
